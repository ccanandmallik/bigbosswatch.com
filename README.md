I made this website starting 7/24/22 and lauched it 7/31/22 in response to being serially harassed by a low talent classless tasteless mob of tech sycophants who couldn't even work a terminal. Hey Tevas!

It pissed them off so they tried to embarass me

A website pissed them off - them being "big tech bosses" -- I thought they made websites? And could take a joke without responding criminally? Oh they were already acting criminally, my bad.

Anyway I pushed it to bigbosswatch.com but I haven't visited that URL in months and I don't intend to until later this month of January, you should be able to run this locally with my started content.

I'm doing this just in case the website went down for "some reason"; my reasons for not checking it since launching are mostly to flex how in control I am compared to... some other people who just can't seem to stop themselves. Sad!
