I made this website starting 7/24/22 and lauched it 7/31/22 in response to being serially harassed by a low talent classless tasteless mob of tech sycophants who couldn't even work a terminal. Hey Tevas!

It pissed them off so they tried to embarass me

A website pissed them off - them being "big tech bosses" -- I thought they made websites? And could take a joke without responding criminally? Oh they were already acting criminally, my bad.

Anyway I pushed it to bigbosswatch.com but I haven't visited that URL in months and I don't intend to until later this month of January, you should be able to run this locally with my started content.
